For this project, I developed a workflow in ArcGIS Pro to disaggregate the data into appropriate time periods in order to analyze species richness between warmer and cooler seasons. Using Visual Studio Code, I generated a table of all unique species in the dataset and calculated the percent difference in observations for each species between warm and cool seasons. I also conducted a Kernel Density estimation to quantify the magnitude of species observations per unit area based on point occurrence data.
This project was conducted to statisfy the course requirment of ENVIRON 859: Geospatial Data Analytics.
